Certainly! Here's an example of documentation for the Hangman program:

## Hangman Game Documentation

The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret word by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses. This Hangman program is implemented in Python and provides a command-line interface for playing the game.

### Prerequisites

Before running the Hangman program, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Usage

To play the Hangman game, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where the Hangman program file is located.

3. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   python hangman.py
   ```

4. The program will display the initial game setup, including the hidden word represented by underscores.

5. Enter a letter to make a guess. You will be prompted to enter a single letter at a time.

6. The program will provide feedback on whether the letter is correct or incorrect.

7. If the guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in the hidden word. If it is incorrect, the program will deduct a try from the total allowed tries and display a part of the hangman ASCII art.

8. Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of tries.

9. If you guess the word correctly within the given tries, you win the game. Otherwise, you lose the game.

### Functionality

The Hangman program provides the following functionality:

- The program selects a random word from a predefined list of words for the player to guess.

- The player can input a single letter at a time as a guess.

- The program validates the input and provides appropriate feedback.

- The program keeps track of the guessed letters and updates the displayed word accordingly.

- The program tracks the remaining tries and displays a hangman ASCII art to visualize the progress.

- The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of tries.

### Customization

You can customize the Hangman game by modifying the following parameters in the code:

- `word_list`: The list of words from which the program selects a random word. You can add or remove words as desired.

- `max_guesses`: The maximum number of allowed incorrect guesses before the game ends. You can adjust this value to increase or decrease the difficulty of the game.
